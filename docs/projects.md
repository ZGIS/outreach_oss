# smart-owc-geojson

OGC OWS Context GeoJSON Encoding Standard 1.0 (14-055r2) for Play Framework 2.5.x

The OGC OWS Context GeoJSON Encoding Standard was finalised and published 2017-04-06.

[https://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=68826]()

The current implementation (from November 2016) relied on preliminary GeoJson 
results from Atom encoding mappings from OWS-10 TestBed working groups during 
the last years, before an official OWC GeoJson encoding was standardised. 
We are currently not supporting the ATOM encoding.
